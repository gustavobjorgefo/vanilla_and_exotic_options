# vanilla_and_exotic_options

I'm currently working on developing my own object-oriented Python code to assess options prices, calculate Greeks values, and implied volatility. The primary objectives of this project are twofold:
- Utilizing it as a tool for evaluating options (both listed and OTC) in the Brazilian market.
- Enhancing my knowledge of Python and delving deeper into its intricacies. As someone without a background in programming, implementing something like this isn't easy, and I anticipate making plenty of mistakes along the way.

This project is open to suggestions, and feedback is always welcome.
